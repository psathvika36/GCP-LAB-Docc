# GCP LAB Documentation

This repository contains the documentation and code for the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Labs using Java Microservices with Spring Cloud and Spring Boot.

## Project Overview

The project includes several microservices built using Java, Spring Boot, and Spring Cloud, designed to demonstrate best practices for building scalable, resilient applications on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The microservices communicate with each other through RESTful APIs and utilize Spring Cloud for service discovery, configuration management, and fault tolerance.

## Features

- **Java Microservices**: The microservices are built using Java and Spring Boot.
- **Spring Cloud Integration**: Microservices use Spring Cloud features such as service discovery, configuration management, and more.
- **GCP Integration**: The project integrates with various Google Cloud services such as Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, and others.
- **Docker**: The microservices are containerized using Docker for easier deployment and scalability.
